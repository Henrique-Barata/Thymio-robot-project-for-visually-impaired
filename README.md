# Thymio-robot-project-for-visually-impaired
The project was developed to explore HRI using a Thymio robot for a Maze Navigation Game for the visually impaired. Due to missing RC5 protocol codes, a smartphone app prototype was created for demonstration purposes. The robot is controlled via its original remote with buttons for movement, stopping, and resetting the game.
